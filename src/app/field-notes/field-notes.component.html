<h1 style="text-align: center;">Field Notes</h1>
<p style="margin: 10px;">This is where I would like scouts to be able to upload pictures and write a description. It can be used to 
    document skills, or simply to record outdoor events such as hiking and camping. Eventually, I would like to 
    have an option to attach an upload to a specific skill. When attached, it would show up under the skills list in the appropriate section.
    Alternatively, there could be a pic load and description attached to each skill part.
